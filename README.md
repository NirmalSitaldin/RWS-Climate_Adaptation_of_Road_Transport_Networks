👋Welcome to the SUM Lab Github repository for the research project **RWS - Climate Adaptation of the Dutch main road network**!

This project is funded by the executive body of the Dutch ministry for Infrastructure & Water Managemenent, Rijkswaterstaat (RWS). 10 Dutch universities and knowledge institutes are part of this research project with the objective of policy design for adaptation of the Dutch infrastructure system against climate change scenario's. Each partner is associated with various aspects of the adaptation process, in which TU Delft takes the lead in researching the adaptation capabilities of the Dutch main road network system. 

Our project is segmented in 3 main research areas, in the following sequence: 

1. Risk analysis of the Dutch main road network against climate-change related, unsafe road conditions 
2. Impact assessment of precipitation-based unsafe road conditions on the Dutch main road network 
3. Adaptation modelling of the Dutch main road network to maintain network resilience in the face of climate-change scenario's

The main outcomes of this project, alongside the code repository, can be found in the remainder of this page.
